# SpaceShips

*Because we always need another Asteroids clone*

## Purpose

Learn about the [Godot](http://godotengine.org) game engine by making a simple game... and I like spaceships.

## Playable?

After a fashion. You can run it from the Godot editor. Controls are:

* W - Forwards
* S - Backwards
* A - Rotate left 
* D - Rotate right
* Q - Strafe left
* E - Strafe right
 
There is no maximum rotationg speed so yes, you can make your ship spin at a zillion RPM if you feel the need to brutalize your
poor pilots.

You can also control the camera zoom

* R - Zoom in
* F - Zoom out

## Graphics

The spaceship is one of the examples that comes with the [Space Ship Construction Kit](http://opengameart.org/content/space-ship-construction-kit)

And the fire / exhaust sprites come from the Godot particles demo application.
